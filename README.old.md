# Tips

- [] Write a good README with basic information (e.g.: how to start the project and how to build it);
- [] There's no screens designed for the mobile version, but if you build a responsive app it's a big plus. We would love to see your design skills as well!
- [] Feel free to work and improve on the available designs. Think of them as guidelines.
- [] There's a "like" button on the details page. It would be great if this information is persistent!
  Prefer to use a css methodology, such as BEM, ITCSS, etc;
- [] Use any CSS extension like LESS or SASS;
- [] Asking questions is good. We will not penalize you for asking questions;
- [] The API server is sometimes slow, so think about loading and empty states throughout your application;
- [] We're looking for signs you understand concepts such as events, promises, and reactivity, and how those concepts are implemented in Javascript;
- [] Unit testing will be greatly valued;
- [] The git history will be evaluated;
- [] Your code will be evaluated by: semantics, structure, legibility, size, elegance (among other factors);
